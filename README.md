In this first part of the webpage :-

        Two heading are created using <h1> and <h2> tags.
        Then the next section is created using the <iframe> element which contains the path to the other webpage I created.
        I created one local.html file to embed it in the main webpage(index.html).
              This local.html webpage was created with only three more tags inside the <body> tag - <h3> for the heading, <p> for writing some text and <br> for line break and going to the next line.
